# Generic In C++

This repository contains examples and explanations of how to use generics (templates) in C++. The purpose is to provide clear and concise demonstrations of generic programming concepts, which are a key feature in C++ for creating flexible and reusable code.

## Contents

### we have two types of files in this repository:

- **`template_functions`**: Introduction to function templates in C++.
- **`template_classes`**: Overview of class templates, showing how to create generic classes.

## Prerequisites

To compile and run the examples in this repository, you need:

- A C++ compiler that supports C++11 or later (e.g., GCC, Clang, MSVC).
- Basic knowledge of C++ programming.

## How to Use

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/genericInCpp.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the directory:
   ```bash
   cd genericInCpp
   ```
3. Compile and run any of the examples using a C++ compiler. For example:
   ```bash
   g++ genericFunction.cpp -o genericFunction
   ./genericFunction
   ```
